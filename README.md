# Edmond-Karp-Algorithm-Max-Flow-Problem
Edmond-Karp Algorithm Max Flow Problem in C++

## Public Functions:
```
Graph g(size) // create new graph g with starting size
addEdge(vertex_a, vertex_b, capacity) //adds directed edge from vertex_a to vertex_b with a capacity
findMaxFlow(source,sink)  //returns max flow as int; prints edges & max flow Path with residual capacity & starting capacity
resize(newsize) // resizes the graph 
```
